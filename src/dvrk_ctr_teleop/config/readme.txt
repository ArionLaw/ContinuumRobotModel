# From Radian

The configs from dvrk_ctr_teleop from the peter francis were changed to do RPR but were
disorganized and mixed. I just put all configs of the latest RPR branch to the rpr folder, and put the old configs
of peter francis in the peter_francis folder. Then changed paths on readme so it works
